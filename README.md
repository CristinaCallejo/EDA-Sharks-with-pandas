SHARK RESEARCH INSTITUTE IS 2020 TOP-RATED NONPROFIT 
https://greatnonprofits.org/org/shark-research-institute-inc

2016:
SRI, along with the New Jersey Maritime Museum presented a Shark Awareness Dinner to commemorate the anniversary of the 1916 shark attacks off the New Jersey coast – Richard G. Fernicola, M.D. author of “12 Days of Terror” and SRI Educational Director Dean Fessler were featured speakers at the event.

2014:
identified the increased risk of shark attacks in North and South Carolina

2005:
The Global Shark Attack File, with verifiable references and a downloadable Excel spreadsheet, is placed online to inform the public and the media of the minimal risk of negative shark encounters.

1992:
SRI agrees to maintain the Global Shark Attack File, a database and case histories of shark-related injuries by and for medical professionals.

THE LEADING SOURCE FOR FACTS USED WORLDWIDE.
The purpose of the Global Shark Attack File is to use forensic analysis to demonstrate and emphasize the likelihood of shark/human interactions in comparison to the myriad dangers that we face in our daily lives. With a better understanding of these interactions we can minimize the possibility of being injured by a shark, and shift the discussion from fear to conservation of all shark species worldwide.

Created by a group of physicians, surgeons, and medical examiners, GSAF contributors and users quickly grew to include marine biologists and shark behaviorists. The GSAF has been maintained by SRI since 1992 and managed since 2010 by SRI team member Ralph Collier, a respected thought leader in shark conservation who has studied shark/human interactions for more than 40 years.
