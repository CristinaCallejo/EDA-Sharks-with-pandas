### INCIDENT LOG

https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm

All individuals survived unless noted otherwise.
Entries on the spreadsheet are color-coded.

• Unprovoked Incidents = Tan
• Provoked Incidents = Orange
• Incidents Involving Watercrafts = Green
• Air / Sea Disasters = Yellow
• Questionable Incidents = Blue

Unprovoked vs. Provoked - GSAF defines a provoked incident as one in which the shark was speared, hooked, captured or in which a human drew "first blood". Although such incidents are of little interest to shark behaviorists, when the species of shark involved is known and pre-op photos of the wounds are available, the bite patterns are of value in determining species of shark involved in other cases when the species could not identified by the patient or witnesses. We know that a live human is rarely perceived as prey by a shark. Many incidents are motivated by curiosity, others may result when a shark perceives a human as a threat or competitor for a food source, and could be classed as "provoked" when examined from the shark's perspective.

Incidents involving watercraft – Incidents in which a boat was bitten or rammed by a shark are in green. However, in cases in which the shark was hooked, netted or gaffed, the entry is orange because they are classed as provoked incidents.

Questionable incidents - Incidents in which there are insufficient data to determine if the injury was caused by a shark or the person drowned and the body was later scavenged by sharks. In a few cases, despite media reports to the contrary, evidence indicated there was no shark involvement whatsoever. Such incidents are in blue.

1891 New York multimillionaire Hermann Oelrichs, who offered a 500 dollar reward for anyone who proved a shark attacked a human. That prize would be worth nearly 13,000 dollars today.

1916, July 1-12, dubbed the “Twelve Days of Terror,” four people died and another was wounded in five New Jersey shark attacks. The attacks garnered national media attention and sparked a newfound fear of sharks.

1975 JAWS film, based on Peter Benchley’s 1974 novel of the same name, ignited a fear in people that eclipsed the 1916 attacks. While the novel was based partially on the New Jersey events, the movie producers exercised extreme artistic license

2015: eight attacks off the coast of North Carolina, people tend to remember “Jaws” and regress to the fear instilled by the movie.

2015 saw the highest number of shark attacks worldwide—98—and six were fatal.

The most shark attacks in a single year. But 2015 did just that, with 98 unprovoked attacks worldwide, beating the previous record of 88 set in 2000, according to the International Shark Attack File housed at the University of Florida.
