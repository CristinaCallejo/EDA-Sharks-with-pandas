##### "IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE, CONSCIOUSLY AND INTELLIGENTLY, THE EFFORTS AND RESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.  IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT EACH RESULT BE TAKEN UP, ELABORATED AND APPLIED BY A FEW SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD."
##### - Albert Einstein.


##### [GLOBAL SHARK ATTACK FILE](https://www.sharks.org/global-shark-attack-file)


In keeping with the philosophy of Albert Einstein, the mission of the Global Shark Attack File by the SRI is to provide current and historical data on shark/human interactions for those who seek accurate and meaningful information and verifiable references.

For researchers needing more data, and for those in the media, the Global Shark Attack File provides direct contact information of the case investigators.

Humans are not on the menu of sharks. Sharks bite humans out of curiosity or to defend themselves.

It is the goal of the Global Shark Attack File to demonstrate and emphasize, through forensic analysis, the significance of shark/human interactions in comparison to the myriad dangers that we face in our daily lives. With a better understanding of these interactions we can minimize the risk of being injured by a shark and concentrate on the conservation of all shark species worldwide.

"Instead of ignoring the problem or pretending that we can put up nets and protect everyone from sharks, what is needed is a public education campaign to teach people how to co-exist with sharks."
  -- Lewis Levine, M.D.

SRI, along with the New Jersey Maritime Museum presented a Shark Awareness Dinner to commemorate the anniversary of the 1916 shark attacks off the New Jersey coast – Richard G. Fernicola, M.D. author of “12 Days of Terror” and SRI Educational Director Dean Fessler were featured speakers at the event.

2014:
identified the increased risk of shark attacks in North and South Carolina

2005:
The Global Shark Attack File, with verifiable references and a downloadable Excel spreadsheet, is placed online to inform the public and the media of the minimal risk of negative shark encounters.

### FLORIDA PROG FOR SHARK RESEARCH + ISAF

International Shark Attack File (ISAF) is the world’s only scientifically documented, comprehensive database of all known shark attacks. Initiated in 1958, there are now more than 6,500 individual investigations covering the period from the early 1500s to the present.

### GSAG LEGEND: INCIDENT LOG


https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm


All individuals survived unless noted otherwise.
Entries on the spreadsheet are color-coded.

• Unprovoked Incidents = Tan
• Provoked Incidents = Orange
• Incidents Involving Watercrafts = Green
• Air / Sea Disasters = Yellow
• Questionable Incidents = Blue

Unprovoked vs. Provoked - GSAF defines a provoked incident as one in which the shark was speared, hooked, captured or in which a human drew "first blood". Although such incidents are of little interest to shark behaviorists, when the species of shark involved is known and pre-op photos of the wounds are available, the bite patterns are of value in determining species of shark involved in other cases when the species could not identified by the patient or witnesses. We know that a live human is rarely perceived as prey by a shark. Many incidents are motivated by curiosity, others may result when a shark perceives a human as a threat or competitor for a food source, and could be classed as "provoked" when examined from the shark's perspective.

Incidents involving watercraft – Incidents in which a boat was bitten or rammed by a shark are in green. However, in cases in which the shark was hooked, netted or gaffed, the entry is orange because they are classed as provoked incidents.

Questionable incidents - Incidents in which there are sufficient data to determine if the injury was caused by a shark or the person drowned and the body was later scavenged by sharks. In a few cases, despite media reports to the contrary, evidence indicated there was no shark involvement whatsoever. Such incidents are labelled in blue.
